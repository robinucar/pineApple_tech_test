## ● We would like you to write a short program that displays each number from 1 to 100.                                                  
## ● For each multiple of 3, print "Pine" instead of the number. 
## ● For each multiple of 5, print "Apple" instead of the number. 
## ● For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "PineApple" instead of ## the number. 



### To run program: node pineApple.js
